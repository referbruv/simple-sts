# Simple Sts
A Minimalistic TokenServer based on the IdentityServer4 framework. Contains assembled and customized logic for Clients, ApiResources, ApiScopes and UserStore with integration to SQL Server database. Works based on the OAuth standards and can work as a boilerplate code for developers looking to setup a minimalistic TokenServer for development or staging environments.

# What is IdentityServer4?

IdentityServer4 is a .NET Core based framework for creating OAuth Token server. 
The library provides the necessary functionalities for building robust and customizable TokenServers which help in separating the User session and token management while the applications can focus on their actual business logic.
